### **Integrated AI Models**

#### **1. Brain Tumor Detection Model**
Our AI model uses **MRI images** to predict different types of brain tumors. The model classifies tumors into the following categories:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

The model leverages **convolutional neural networks (CNN)** to analyze the features of MRI scans, providing highly accurate predictions based on pre-trained data.

*Graphics suggestion*: Include a simple flowchart or animation showing how the MRI images are processed by the model to identify the tumor type.

#### **2. Pneumonia Detection Model**
This AI model analyzes **chest X-ray images** to detect signs of pneumonia. The model categorizes the image as either:
- **Pneumonia**
- **Normal**

Using **data augmentation techniques** and **CNN layers**, the model is trained to identify pneumonia at an early stage, offering crucial insights for timely medical intervention.

*Graphics suggestion*: A visual comparison of a healthy lung X-ray and a pneumonia-affected X-ray, with annotations highlighting the differences.

#### **3. Skin Cancer Detection Model**
Our skin cancer detection model analyzes skin images to identify different types of skin cancer. It categorizes skin lesions as:
- **Actinic Keratosis**
- **Basal Cell Carcinoma**
- **Melanoma**
- **Seborrheic Keratosis**
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
- **Other Types**

This model also uses **CNNs** for pattern recognition, trained on a large dataset of skin images to provide accurate results.

*Graphics suggestion*: Display a carousel of skin images showing examples of each category, with brief descriptions of each type of skin cancer.

### **Google Gemini Chatbot**

The **Google Gemini chatbot** integrated into the app serves as your personal medical assistant. It helps users by:
- **Answering medical queries** related to symptoms, diseases, and treatment options.
- **Providing diagnostic recommendations** based on user input and medical images.
- **Guiding users** in uploading images or entering symptoms for further analysis.

The chatbot uses **natural language processing** (NLP) to understand and respond to text-based input and can assist in predicting potential health issues based on the symptoms provided.

*Graphics suggestion*: A chatbot interface with chat bubbles and icons to represent different medical topics (e.g., symptom checker, disease prediction, medical advice). You could also add a button that shows the chatbot's activity, like "Analyzing symptoms..." for added interactivity.

### **User Interaction Features**

To enhance the experience, the app provides a **graphical interface** that allows users to:
- **Upload images** directly from their device.
- **Interact with the chatbot** via text input or voice commands.
- **View predictions** with a graphical representation of the model's confidence level.

*Graphics suggestion*: Include progress bars and visual indicators (e.g., a loading circle when the model is processing the image) to give users real-time feedback while waiting for the results.

### **How It Works**

1. **Step 1: Upload Your Medical Image**
   - Upload your MRI, X-ray, or skin image for analysis.

2. **Step 2: Chat with the Google Gemini Bot**
   - Type or speak your symptoms to the Google Gemini chatbot to get personalized health advice.

3. **Step 3: Receive Diagnosis**
   - Get your diagnosis from the AI models with clear explanations and suggestions for next steps.

*Graphics suggestion*: A step-by-step graphical tutorial (or animated GIF) illustrating the user journey from uploading an image to receiving a diagnosis.

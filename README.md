### **Integrated AI Models**

#### **1. Brain Tumor Detection Model**
Our AI model uses **MRI images** to predict different types of brain tumors. The model classifies tumors into the following categories:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

The model leverages **convolutional neural networks (CNN)** to analyze the features of MRI scans, providing highly accurate predictions based on pre-trained data.

#### **2. Pneumonia Detection Model**
This AI model analyzes **chest X-ray images** to detect signs of pneumonia. The model categorizes the image as either:
- **Pneumonia**
- **Normal**

Using **data augmentation techniques** and **CNN layers**, the model is trained to identify pneumonia at an early stage, offering crucial insights for timely medical intervention.

#### **3. Skin Cancer Detection Model**
Our skin cancer detection model analyzes skin images to identify different types of skin cancer. It categorizes skin lesions as:
- **Actinic Keratosis**
- **Basal Cell Carcinoma**
- **Melanoma**
- **Seborrheic Keratosis**
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
- **Other Types**

This model also uses **CNNs** for pattern recognition, trained on a large dataset of skin images to provide accurate results.

### **Google Gemini Chatbot**

The **Google Gemini chatbot** integrated into the app serves as your personal medical assistant. It helps users by:
- **Answering medical queries** related to symptoms, diseases, and treatment options.
- **Providing diagnostic recommendations** based on user input and medical images.
- **Guiding users** in uploading images or entering symptoms for further analysis.

The chatbot uses **natural language processing** (NLP) to understand and respond to text-based input and can assist in predicting potential health issues based on the symptoms provided.
